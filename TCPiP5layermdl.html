        TCP/IP 5 layer model
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>
            layer 1
            Physical layer - represents physical devices that interconnect computers. 
            Includes the specifications for the networking cables and also deals with cabling and connectors.
            connectors that join devices together along with specifications describing how signals are sent over these connections
        </p> 
        <p>
            layer 2
            Data link or network access layer: - is responsible for defining a common way of interpreting these signals so network devices can communicate. 
            Lots of protocols exist at the data link layer but the most common is ethernet. 
            It's this layer that allows different networks to communicate with each other through devices known as routers.
            on this layer the Ethernet standards and some wireless technologies operate . 
        </p>  
        <p>
            layer 3
            Network layer /Internetwork - A collection of networks connected together through routers, eg internet.
            IP is an example of a network layer (layer 3) protocol in the five-layer TCP/IP model.
            Router operates on network layer.
        </p> 
        <p>
            layer 4
            transport layer- While the network layer delivers data between two individual nodes, the transport layer sorts out which client and server programs are supposed to get that data.
        </p>
        <p>
            layer 5
            Application layer - contains different protocols eg Protocols used to allow you to browse the web or send and receive email.
            A Browser - is an example of something that works on the application layer (layer 5 of the five-layer TCP/IP model)
        </p>

        <p>            
        1. Application layer - is concerned with application or process communication. eg SMTP for email. includes HTTP, DNS, IMAP, SMTP, SNMP, SSH, TLS , SSL.
        2. Transport layer -The protocols associated with this layer are TCP and UDP. TCP is responsible for flow control. UDP is responsible for providing a datagram service. Has TCP and UDP.
        3. Internet layer -responsible for exchanging datagrams. A datagram contains the data from the transport layer and adds in the origin and recipient IP addresses.protocols are IP,IPV4, IPV6, ICMP, IPsec.
        4. Network access layer -defining how the data is sent across the network.protocols eg ARP,MAC, Ethernet, digital subscriber line (DSL), and Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN).
